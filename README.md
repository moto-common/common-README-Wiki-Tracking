# moto-common Project
The moto-common project aims to goal is to support AOSP development for all Motorola devices under a common tree. This makes bringups of new Motorola devices easier and allows fixes to be shared throughout all supported targets. 

## Device Support
Support for devices is added as long as a developer steps up to create the initial trees, further development from there is trivial. As part of the moto-common project, scripts handle the detection of fingerprint and some other device specific hardware in order to make bringups and device maintainence easier.
